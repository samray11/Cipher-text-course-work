HEWINDOWINTHEFORMOFASPIRITLESS

I wrote a program to solve this.
The program essentially rearranges the ciphertext into rows and columns in an order where
index 0 is is the first row/colum, index 1 is the second row and first column,
index 2 is the third row on the first column.It will go to the next column when the column length
is full, which is the cipherlength divides by the key (which by trial and error I determined)to be 5.
Please find attached the code cipher5.java
