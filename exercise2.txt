FATRADESMANATFINDINGTHATAJOBHE

To decipher this I wrote a program, I began by extending the key TESSOFTHEDURBERVILLES to
TESSOFTHEDURBERVILLESTESSOFTHE, to match the length of the cipher text.
In order to determine the plain text I used modular arithmetic where the
char value being decrypted was subtracted from the key character modulos the key length,
plus the length of the alphabet (26) and then finding the modulos 26 of the entire calculation
so far. (ciph[i] - key[i % key.length]+ 26)%26; <-- easier to understand
the value that calculation produces corresponds to a character in the alphabet char list.
