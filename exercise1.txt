I made a program that goes through the cipher text and performs modular arithmetic to shift
the letters of the alphabet by a given number (the key). I do this for each possible key
 0-26 and check each output to see if it is legible english, I found that key 6 was 
the one that produced plain text.
To view the code please look for cipher.java
