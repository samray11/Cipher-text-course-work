For this cipher I used a mixture of a programmatical and non-programmatical solution.
I wrote a program to do assit in this by having it put each character in a hashmap
that also included the number of times it occurs. I was given the following output
{A=13, B=14, C=1, D=54, F=52, G=9, H=41, I=146, J=31, K=11, L=47, M=16, N=95, O=43, P=6, Q=30, S=20, T=1, U=10, V=61, W=14, X=28, Y=24, Z=67, |=6}
This set made it clear what some characters were likely to be. For example, I was likely to be a SPACE, as it occured so
many times. N, being the second most common was likely to be E as the most commonly used letter in the alphabet. I refferred to an alphabet
frequency table to assit in determining characters based on their frequency. To test them, I used String.replace(); to replace a handful of characters
based on their frequency, which allowed me to work out letters of short words such as THE, WHO, A, IT, TO, etc. From there, words began to become legible
or at the very least guessible. From there, I used a selection of if statments to go through the string and replace the characters, I added more and more if statments
until every character was correct.The program goes through each character of the string, if it is x, replace it with y. if(ciph.charAt(i) == 'N'){plain += "E";}
